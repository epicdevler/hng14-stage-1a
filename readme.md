:rocket: Frontend Wizards — Stage 1a Task
Advanced Todo Card (Interactive & Stateful)

Overview:
In Stage 1, you will extend your Stage 0 Todo Card into a more interactive, stateful, and slightly more “app-like” component. You are still building a single Todo Card, not a full app. The card should now support:


Editable content
Status transitions
Priority changes
Expand / collapse behavior
More dynamic time handling
Slightly richer accessibility patterns


:new: Enhancements: Add the following functionality:


Editing mode: When the edit button is clicked, the card should enter edit mode.
Edit form container → data-testid="test-todo-edit-form"
Title input → data-testid="test-todo-edit-title-input"
Description textarea →data-testid="test-todo-edit-description-input"
Priority select dropdown → data-testid="test-todo-edit-priority-select"
Due date input → data-testid="test-todo-edit-due-date-input"
Save button → data-testid="test-todo-save-button"
Cancel button → data-testid="test-todo-cancel-button"




Status Controls: Instead of just displaying status, allow the user to toggle it.
Add: 
Status dropdown or segmented control → data-testid="test-todo-status-control"

Allowed statuses: "Pending" , "In Progress"  and "Done"




Priority Indicator Enhancements: 
Add:
Priority indicator → data-testid="test-todo-priority-indicator"

This could be:
A colored dot
An icon
A left border accent
Background color change

It must visually change depending on: "Low" , "Medium" , "High"




Expand / Collapse Behavior: The description should be collapsible if it's too long.
Add:
Expand/collapse toggle button → data-testid="test-todo-expand-toggle"
Collapsible container → data-testid="test-todo-collapsible-section"

Behavior:
Default collapsed if description exceeds certain length
Clicking expand reveals full content
Toggle must be keyboard accessible





Time Management Enhancements
Add:
Overdue indicator → data-testid="test-todo-overdue-indicator"

If overdue:
Show a visible visual change (e.g., red text or badge)
Show explicit "Overdue" indicator

Time logic should now:
Update every 30–60 seconds
Show granular time: "Due in 2 days" , "Due in 3 hours" , "Due in 45 minutes" , "Overdue by 1 hour"

If status becomes "Done":
Time remaining should stop updating
Replace with: "Completed"






:dart: Behavioral Requirements: 

1. Edit Mode

Clicking Edit switches into edit form
Save updates the card values
Cancel restores previous values
Edit mode must:
Trap focus inside form (optional bonus)
Return focus to Edit button when closed


2. Status Logic Rules

If checkbox toggled → status becomes "Done"
If status manually set to "Done" → checkbox becomes checked
If unchecked after "Done"→ revert to "Pending"
Status must stay visually synced with: Checkbox , Status display  and Status control


3. Visual State Changes

"Done" → strike-through title + muted colors
"High priority" → strong visual indicator
"Overdue" → red accent
"In Progress" → distinct visual style


:wheelchair: Accessibility Requirements:


Edit form fields must have `<label for="">`
Status dropdown must have accessible name
Expand toggle must use: aria-expanded , aria-controls
Collapsible section must have matching id
Live time updates should use aria-live="polite"



Keyboard flow must remain: Tab →
Checkbox
Status control
Expand toggle
Edit
Delete
Save/Cancel (in edit mode)



:iphone: Responsiveness 

Layout adapts to:

320px mobile
768px tablet
1024px+

Edit form fields stack vertically on mobile
On desktop:

Priority & status may align horizontally

No layout breaking when:

Title is long
Tags wrap to multiple lines
Description is extremely long


:test_tube:  Acceptance Criteria

All Stage 0 testids still exist
All new testids exist and work
Edit mode fully functional
Status transitions synchronized
Expand/collapse accessible
Overdue logic correct
No visual overflow at any size
Keyboard fully usable
Time updates properly
Clean state management
